            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-10</p>

            <p>
                Welcome to Kasboek ("we," "us," or "our"). By using the app, you
                agree to these Terms and Conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By using Kasboek, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree,
                please do not use the app.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
            <p>
                You agree to use the app lawfully and not to interfere with its
                normal operation, security, or availability.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Accounts (Optional)</h2>
            <p>
                Creating an account is optional. If you create an account, you
                are responsible for keeping your credentials secure and for all
                activity under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Your Data</h2>
            <p>
                You remain the owner of the data you enter into the app. By
                using cloud backup, you authorize us to store and process that
                data to provide the service.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We may update, change, or discontinue features at any time.
                We are not liable for any modification, suspension, or
                discontinuance of the app.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no system
                is completely secure. You use the app at your own risk.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                The app, its content, and its design are owned by Kasboek and
                protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Kasboek and its
                developers are not liable for indirect, incidental, special,
                consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data or
                profits.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the
                Netherlands, without regard to conflict of law principles.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of
                the app after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
