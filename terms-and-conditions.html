                If the app requires account creation, you are responsible for
                maintaining the confidentiality of your account information. You
                agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating

            <p>
                We take reasonable measures to secure your data. However, you

                Any content you contribute to the app, such as financial
                transactions or user-generated data, remains your property. By
                providing content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive,
                royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
                translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display

                We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account and
                access to the app at our sole discretion, without prior notice

                changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your
                continued use of the app after changes to the terms are posted
                constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                The Financial Tracker app and its original content, features,

                In no event shall Financial Tracker, its developers, or its
                affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
                consequential, or punitive damages, including without
                limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
                intangible losses resulting from your access to or use of, or
                inability to access or use the app.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions shall be governed and construed in
                accordance with the laws applicable worldwide, without regard to

                not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,

            <h2>12. Severability</h2>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid
                or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated
                to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions
                shall remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Waiver</h2>
            <p>
                The failure of Financial Tracker to enforce any right or
                provision of these Terms and Conditions will not be considered a
                waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or
                provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a
                duly authorized representative of Financial Tracker.
            </p>
